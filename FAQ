--[ 1 - Compilation & Installation

1.1 - Does not compile :/ Baehehahah

    First try ./configure --enable-dist. This configures thcrut to use
its own version of libnet and libpcre.

    If this wont work try to use --with-include=<dir> and --with-libs=<dir>
to set the correct include and library path of the libpcap files.


--[ Using thcrut

2.1 - Why does my CPU jump to 100% after a few minutes?

    Some linux kernel (my 2.4.19-gentoo-r10) require >5000 ms for a simple
sendto() system call _after_ a lot of packets have been send to _many_ (>16.000)
different IPs. Update your kernel (sendto() remains at 12ms after 1.000.000
sendto() calls on the 2.4.20 stock kernel).

2.2 - Why is thcrut so slow on local networks?

    The kernel has to resolve the mac of every computer on the local
network first. This makes the system slow. Sometimes the arp table
overflows in which case thcrut tries to resend the packet.

    Solution: Use -l 100 or less if you have a slow machiene and want to
scan a local network.
