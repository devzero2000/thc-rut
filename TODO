- Interpret FP's from a file full of banners etc..
  (also put nmap-os-fingerprints in there. See BUGS/info.txt for more details).

- The timeout for banner scans etc suxx. But we can bind to a certain
  port and then sniff the RST and instantly switch to next state
  if the port is closed. This would mean no 1 sec timeout for
  every port we check.

- fast reverse ip resolver.
  - use nameservers from /etc/resolv.conf
    and/or nameserver the user can specify on command line.

- better option support:
  thcrut dhcp <options>
  thcrut icmp <options>
  thcrut bootp <options>
  thcrut arp <options>
  thcrut dns <options>
  thcrut rut <options>
